# 46 Simple Exercises

This repo is based on [this website](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html) that offers 46 exercises to practice one's Python skills. I will be working through these exercises in both Python and C.

Some of the function names that the site suggests overlap with built-in functions in Python. So in exercises where this is the case, I will give the function a different name, but it will retain the suggested functionality.
